When cleaning the pacifier subsequently, follow these three simple steps:<br><br>Put the pacifiers in a clean bowl. Pour them with plenty of boiling water.<br>Let the pacifiers soak for approx. 5 min.<br>Pick them up and let them dry on a clean towel.<br><br>After cleaning it is not unusual that water remains in the nipple,<br>simply just squeeze the nipple flat to press out the excess water.<br>If water drops remain in the nipple, just let the pacifier air-dry.<br><br><strong>Do not cook!</strong><br>Pacifiers are not meant to be boiled and are therefore destroyed by the high heat.<br>Instead, follow the instructions above, and you are sure to kill the bacteria without compromising the durability of the pacifier.<br><br><strong>Don’ts</strong><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not leave natural rubber latex pacifiers in direct sunlight.</li>\n<li>Do not put the pacifiers in the dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Do not use UV for the pacifiers.</li>\n<li>Do not freeze the pacifiers.</li>\n<li>Do not steam over 100°.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>TIP: When the child is over 3 months, you can also rinse the pacifier by placing them in a sieve and pouring them with boiling water. This method is faster and avoids water collecting inside the nipple.<br><br><strong>Replacement</strong><br>We recommend a replacement of pacifiers every 4-6 weeks for both safety and hygienic reasons.<br><br>Natural rubber latex pacifiers must be replaced when you see the following signs:<br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes in the surface</li>\n<li>Changes in size</li>\n<li>Change in shape</li>\n<li>Rupture in the material</li>\n<li>Becomes brittle or sticky</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>",

But that doesn’t make our buddy floss any less important. It’s actually incredibly important, as it helps get all that funk out from in between your teeth. BUT THEN WHAT? Every time it’s used that means another several feet (usually) of non-biodegradable plastic string ends up in the garbage! You don’t have to be president of the environmental club to imagine what thousands of miles of plastic floss in oceans and landfills can do to our planet’s animal inhabitants.</p>\n<h3><span>SO GO NATURAL, BABY!</span></h3>\n<p>Our dental floss is made from natural organic silk, and it’s encased in a cool, plant-based plastic shell. We’ve eliminated the need for a plastic case, as the packaging itself becomes your floss dispenser! Pop it open, thread it, close it, use it.  Oh, stick “buy it” in there, first. 🙂 If you want to order our products in bulk or wholesale, we can help you with that too!</p>\n<ul class=\"iconlist iconlist \">\n<li>\n<img src=\"https://woobamboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gray-leaf-icon.gif\" alt=\"gray-leaf-icon\"><span> </span>Made with natural, biodegradable silk</li>\n<li>\n<img src=\"https://woobamboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gray-leaf-icon.gif\" alt=\"gray-leaf-icon\"><span> </span>Coated with natural wax</li>\n<li>\n<img src=\"https://woobamboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gray-leaf-icon.gif\" alt=\"gray-leaf-icon\"><span> </span>Packaged in renewable plant-based plastic</li>\n<li>\n<img src=\"https://woobamboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gray-leaf-icon.gif\" alt=\"gray-leaf-icon\"><span> </span>Soy-based ink &amp; post-consumer waste</li>\n<li>\n<img src=\"https://woobamboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gray-leaf-icon.gif\" alt=\"gray-leaf-icon\"><span> </span>Finely crafted in Italy</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>",

But that doesn’t make our buddy floss any less important. It’s actually incredibly important, as it helps get all that funk out from in between your teeth. BUT THEN WHAT? Every time it’s used that means another several feet (usually) of non-biodegradable plastic string ends up in the garbage! You don’t have to be president of the environmental club to imagine what thousands of miles of plastic floss in oceans and landfills can do to our planet’s animal inhabitants.</p>\n<h3><span>SO GO NATURAL, BABY!</span></h3>\n<p>Our dental floss is made from natural organic silk, and it’s encased in a cool, plant-based plastic shell. We’ve eliminated the need for a plastic case, as the packaging itself becomes your floss dispenser! Pop it open, thread it, close it, use it.  Oh, stick “buy it” in there, first. 🙂 If you want to order our products in bulk or wholesale, we can help you with that too!</p>\n<ul class=\"iconlist iconlist \">\n<li>\n<img src=\"https://woobamboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gray-leaf-icon.gif\" alt=\"gray-leaf-icon\"><span> </span>Made with natural, biodegradable silk</li>\n<li>\n<img src=\"https://woobamboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gray-leaf-icon.gif\" alt=\"gray-leaf-icon\"><span> </span>Coated with natural wax</li>\n<li>\n<img src=\"https://woobamboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gray-leaf-icon.gif\" alt=\"gray-leaf-icon\"><span> </span>Packaged in renewable plant-based plastic</li>\n<li>\n<img src=\"https://woobamboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gray-leaf-icon.gif\" alt=\"gray-leaf-icon\"><span> </span>Soy-based ink &amp; post-consumer waste</li>\n<li>\n<img src=\"https://woobamboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gray-leaf-icon.gif\" alt=\"gray-leaf-icon\"><span> </span>Finely crafted in Italy</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>",
